// spanning trees
// subgraph
// a graph whose vertices and edges are subsets of original graph g

// connected graph - a graph that is connected in a sense of a topological space, there is a path from any node to any other node
// completed graph - an undirected graph in which every pair of vertices is connected by a unique edge
// spanning tree - should be a subgraph and a connected graph
// all vertices of G must be present in S
// No. of edges in S should be V-1

// complete graph has n^n-2 spanning trees (n is the no. of vertices)

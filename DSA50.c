// adjacency list - mark the nodes with the list of its neighbors
// adjacency matrix - Aij if there is an edge between i and j (1) else 0
// cost adjacency matrix - Aij if there is an edge between i and j (cost) else 0// if cost is 0 in any case we change all 0s to -1 instead the cost 0
// edge set - pair of nodes connected by edges

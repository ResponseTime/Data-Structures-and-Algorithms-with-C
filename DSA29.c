// tree is ideal for representing hierarchical data
// types of trees

// 1) full or strict binary tree - all nodes have 2 or 0 children
// 2) perfect binary tree - all nodes have 2 children + all leaf nodes are on the same level
// 3) complete binary tree - all levels are filled except possibly the last level + last level is left aligned
// 4) degenerate tree - every parent node has exactly one child

// skewed tree - right , left
